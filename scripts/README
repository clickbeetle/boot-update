module auto-detection

autofunk.py can be run after booting a kernel and attempts to discover what
modules are actually used, versus the modules that were actually loaded. It can
be run after boot and its output used to figure out what modules an initrd does
not need to load or include "next time".

reqmod-gregkh.sh is a script that will use sysfs to list the modules required
to boot. You may need to be already running the kernel you want to boot, making
it similar to the above method. It does not include filesystems or other
important things like ipv6, etc.
