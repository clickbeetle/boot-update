Automatically create a boot loader configuration file
-----------------------------------------------------

:Author: Daniel Robbins <drobbins@funtoo.org>
:Version: ##VERSION##
:Manual section: 8
:Manual group: Funtoo Linux Core System

SYNOPSIS
--------

The standard invocation of the command is as follows with no options or
arguments, which causes a boot loader configuration file to be (re)generated
based on settings in */etc/boot.conf*:

  **boot-update**

Typically, **boot-update** would be run if the contents of */etc/boot.conf*
were changed by the user, or additional kernels were installed. This would allow
the boot loader menu to reflect these changes.

OPTIONS
-------

--showdefaults               Show hard-coded (user-overrideable) settings
--show <sect/var>            Display variable "var" defined in section "sect"
                             in */etc/boot.conf*
-C, --check                  Validate configuration file, but do nothing else
-V, --verbose                Verbose mode
-h, --help                   Display this information
-l, --license                Display license information

DESCRIPTION
-----------

*boot-update* is a system tool developed by Daniel Robbins of Funtoo that
will generate a boot loader configuration file based on settings stored in
*/etc/boot.conf*. *boot-update* was originally created as an enhanced
replacement of the upstream GRUB-1.97+ configuration system. GRUB-1.97+'s boot
loader configuration file is stored at */boot/grub/grub.cfg*, is quite
complex and is not intended to be edited directly by system administrators.

*boot-update* has since been extended to support GRUB (*sys-boot/grub*), GRUB
Legacy (*sys-boot/grub-legacy*) and (alpha) LILO (*sys-boot/lilo*).  This
allows a single file, */etc/boot.conf*, to store boot-related information in a
boot-loader-independent way, thus simplifying boot loader configuration and
providing advanced features to all popular boot loaders.

The normal way to use *boot-update* is to run the command with no options
or arguments as root, which will cause a new boot loader configuration file
to be generated. For detailed information on the process that *boot-update*
uses to generate boot loader configuration files, please see *boot.conf(5)*.
